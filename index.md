### Hi! I'm Natalie Kwong. I am a third-year undergraduate student studying **Cognitive Science (Machine Learning)** as a major and **Computer Science** as a minor. I am interested in *data science* and *software engineering*, and hope to be a part of projects focused around issues such as climate change and social injustice - I am fascinated by the relationship between technology and social sciences. As Carly Fiorina said,
>  Many people see technology as the problem behind the so-called digital divide. Others see it as the solution. Technology is neither. It must operate in conjunction with business, economic, political and social system.

I have come a long way from learning introductory programming like `print("Hello World!)`, but I know I still have a lot to learn and that my career path is just beginning.
